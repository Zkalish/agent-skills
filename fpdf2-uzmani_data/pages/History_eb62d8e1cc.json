  "content": "This project, fpdf2 is a fork of the PyFPDF project, which can still be found on GitHub at reingart/pyfpdf, but has been totally inactive since January 2018, and has not seen any new release since 2015.\n\nAbout the original PyFPDF lib:\n\nThis project started as a Python fork of the FPDF PHP library, ported to Python by Max Pat in 2006: http://www.fpdf.org/dl.php?id=94. The original FPDF library was developed in PHP several years ago, and has been ported to many programming languages: http://www.fpdf.org. Later, in the Python FPDF library, code for native reading TTF fonts was added. In 2008 it was moved from a SVN repository to git on Google Code by Mariano Reingart, who became the maintainer of FPDF. In 2013, it was migrated to GitHub: https://github.com/reingart/pyfpdf. You can still access the old issues, and old wiki, that were moved to a dedicated repository. The original roadmap can also still be found there: https://github.com/reingart/pyfpdf/wiki/Roadmap\n\nDuring the spring of 2016, David Ankin (@alexanderankin) started a fork of PyFPDF, and added the first commit of what became fpdf2: bd608e4. On May of 2017, the first release of fpdf2 was published on Pypi: v2.0.0.\n\nOn 2020, the first PRs were merged from external contributors. At the end of the year, Lucas Cimon (@Lucas-C) started contributing several improvements, in order to use fpdf2 for his Undying Dusk project. Version 2.1.0 was released and on 2021/01/10 fpdf2 was moved to a dedicated PyFPDF GitHub organization, and @Lucas-C became another maintainer of the project.\n\nOn 2023/08/04, fpdf2 moved to the py-pdf organization: https://github.com/py-pdf/fpdf2. The context for this move can be found there: discussion #752. On this date, the PyFPDF GitHub organization has been archived. The same month, Georg Mischler (@gmischler) and Anderson Herzogenrath da Costa (@andersonhc) joined the project as new maintainers.\n\nfpdf2 aims to be fully compatible with PyFPDF original code (fpdf==1.7.2).\n\nThe notable exceptions are:\n\nAdditionally, HTML rendering is not guaranteed to be identical regarding whitespace, especially since version 2.7.6 and the new set of classes introduced to manage text flow: Text Flow Regions\n\nSome features are also deprecated. As of version 2.8.4 they still work but generate a warning when used:\n\nNote that DeprecationWarning messages are not displayed by Python by default. To get warned about deprecated features used in your code, you must execute your scripts with the -Wd option (cf. documentation), or enable them programmatically with warnings.simplefilter('default', DeprecationWarning).",
